/**
 * This OpMode uses the common Pushbot hardware class to define the devices on the robot.
 * All device access is managed through the HardwarePushbot class.
 * The code is structured as a LinearOpMode
 *
 * This particular OpMode executes a POV Game style Teleop for a PushBot
 * In this mode the left stick moves the robot FWD and back, the Right stick turns left and right.
 * It raises and lowers the claw using the Gampad Y and A buttons respectively.
 * It also opens and closes the claws slowly using the left and right Bumper buttons.
 *
 * Use Android Studios to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this opmode to the Driver Station OpMode list
